We’re still running our regularly scheduled Bière & Code evenings in Paris, but if you happen to be in Montréal for the holidays, Raph is hosting a small Bière & Code & Beer meetup there on **Thursday, December 18, 2025**, from **6:00–8:00 p.m. (EST)**.

It’ll be a casual, franglais-friendly hangout to grab a beer, talk tech, and meet local folks in the Montréal tech scene.

- **When:** Thursday, December 18, 2025, 6–8 p.m. EST  
- **Where:** [probably] Brutopia - Brewpub, 1219 Rue Crescent, Montréal, QC H3G 2B1, Canada  
- **Info & RSVP:** https://luma.com/rmcbux3i

If you’re around and want to join, please RSVP on the Luma page so we have an idea of numbers. The location is technically subject to change, so keep an eye on that page for any last‑minute updates.
