We're excited to share that the Bière & Code website has received a comprehensive redesign! The new look maintains our welcoming, community-focused spirit while providing a more sophisticated and warm visual experience.

## What Changed?

The redesign ([PR #25](https://github.com/bierecode/bierecode/pull/25)) touched nearly every aspect of the site:

### Visual Design
- **New Color Palette**: Shifted from bright yellow to warm earth tones (cream #fff0cb, burnt orange #cc6c11, deep brown #3f573e)
- **Refined Typography**: Fluid type system with responsive scaling for better readability across all devices
- **Modern Layout**: Generous whitespace and breathing room between sections
- **Enhanced Navigation**: Fixed header with smooth transitions and hover effects

### Homepage Restructure
- Hero section with clear tagline: "Where technology meets community"
- Three feature cards highlighting Monthly Meetups, Community Updates, and our Open to All philosophy
- "Why Bière & Code?" section explaining our three pillars: Learn, Relax, Network
- "First Time?" callout to help newcomers feel welcome
- Prominent Meetup CTA for easy event access

### Design Details
- Pill-shaped buttons with smooth hover transitions
- Card hover effects with subtle lift and background tint
- Animated logo fade-in and navigation underlines
- Strategic use of orange color reserved for primary actions
- Enhanced footer with mission statement, quick links, and social connections

### Content Improvements
- More professional yet approachable tone throughout
- Better bilingual support (English/French)
- Social proof messaging ("Join 150+ tech enthusiasts")
- Clearer event details and format information

## The Stats

The redesign involved:
- **12 files changed**
- **1,319 additions** and **144 deletions**
- **4 commits** with iterative improvements
- All pages updated consistently: homepage, about, updates, and demo days

## Built with SAM & Claude Code

This entire redesign was created using **Claude Code** through [SAM (Simple Agent Manager)](https://github.com/raphaeltm/simple-agent-manager), a project by Raph (founder of Bière & Code).

SAM provides a web interface for Claude Code, making it easy to collaborate on development tasks with AI assistance. From initial design exploration to implementation, testing, and this very update post - everything was built through the SAM interface!

## Design Inspiration

The redesign drew inspiration from [beingnbecoming.org](https://beingnbecoming.org), adopting a warm, inviting aesthetic with generous spacing and thoughtful typography while maintaining the unique character of Bière & Code.

## What's Next?

The design is live! Check out the new look and let us know what you think. We're always iterating and improving based on community feedback.

Join us at our next meetup to discuss the redesign (and everything else tech!) over a beer.
